He looked  anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon  tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under  sentence of execution.' 'What for?' said Alice. 'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked. 'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said  \"What for?\"' 'She boxed the Queen's ears&mdash;' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little  scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened  tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the  Queen said&mdash;' 'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and  people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each  other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game  began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in  her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,  the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves  up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under  her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got  its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a  blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,  with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out  laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin  again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled  itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was  generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the  hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up  and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the  conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling  all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short  time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and  shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a  minute. Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any  dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,  'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully  fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one  left alive!' She was looking about for",
